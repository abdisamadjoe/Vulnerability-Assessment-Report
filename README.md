# Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Plan for a Small Business System

**Date:** 13th August 2024

## Scenario

I was hired as a cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company where employees work remotely from various locations worldwide. The companyâ€™s database server, which stores crucial information, has been open to the public since its launch three years ago. Recognizing the open access as a serious vulnerability, I was tasked with conducting a vulnerability assessment to communicate the potential risks to decision-makers and to develop a plan to secure the system.

## System Description

The assessment focused on a server equipped with a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. The server has a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope

The scope of the vulnerability assessment covered the current access controls of the system. The assessment spanned three months, from June 2024 to August 2024, guided by NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 for risk analysis.

## Purpose

The database server is critical for storing and managing large amounts of data, including customer, campaign, and analytic information. It is essential to secure this system due to its regular use in marketing operations.

## Risk Assessment

I evaluated the following risks based on the vulnerability of the open access permissions:

| Threat Source | Threat Event                      | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| Hacker        | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| Employee      | Disrupt mission-critical operations | 2          | 3        | 6    |
| Customer      | Alter/Delete critical information  | 1          | 3        | 3    |

## Approach

Risks were assessed considering the data storage and management procedures of the business. Potential threat sources and events were evaluated based on the likelihood of a security incident due to the open access permissions. The severity of potential incidents was weighed against their impact on daily operations.

## Remediation Strategy

To address the identified risks, I recommend implementing robust authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the database server. This involves employing strong passwords and role-based access controls, along with multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges effectively. Additionally, it is crucial to encrypt data in transit using TLS instead of SSL to enhance security. To further protect the system, applying IP allow-listing to restrict access to corporate offices will prevent unauthorized users from connecting to the database from the internet.
